## Credits

* **NeoForge** - Thank you to the NeoForged team for developing a great modloader.

## Future

A major goal is to support Fabric once the NeoForge version is complete. This is
seriously important to me as it provides ultimate freedom to the player to use
whichever loader they want. I have tested Architectury implementations, and they
are promising; however, there is still some manual implementation needed for each
modloader that meant I would not want to release depending on it just yet.
